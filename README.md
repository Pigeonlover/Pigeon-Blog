## What Did I Achieve?

- Created a table for the posts and one for the comments. Each comment is connected to a post using a foreign key.
- Comments have a Delete button so users can delete their comment.
- There are two forms: one to create a new blog post (and you are redirected to the Posts page after you submit), and another to add a new comment to one of the blog posts.
- Each post has its own dynamic route, and all the comments present or submitted there are associated with that post.
- I managed to do more complete styling compared to last week's project in React, and I'm happier this time with how it came out. It's also more responsive.

## What Wasn't I Happy With?

Shockingly, I didn't struggle too much with anything in particular in this project, unlike past ones where I always had 1 or 2 things really frustrating me. To tell the truth, I was unsure about Next.js as we were learning it in lesson, but when I started making this app and saw how seamlessly and quickly I could make a CRUD app, I sort of had an epiphany. It was a lot easier and less messy than trying to make a full-stack in React (I still have trauma from that one last week...).
I guess I didn't achieve the stretch goals, like for example being able to filter posts by their category. I didn't try because this weekend I was busy, but I'm guessing you do it by adding different category terms to a 'category' column in the table? And then in the code you filter for them using a query selector? I remember we did that a couple of weeks ago in a demo, but I should add that to this project one day for sure.

## References

I didn't use as many references this time as in the past, as the demos from lessons were more than enough to help me.

But I did use docs as always for Tailwind styling --> https://devdocs.io/tailwindcss/
The docs for Next.js --> https://en.nextjs.im/docs/app/getting-started/fetching-data and https://en.nextjs.im/docs/app/getting-started/updating-data
